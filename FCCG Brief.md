A community-oriented group created from one of the project legs of Silicon Village.  
We have become the "feet on the ground" for the pent up demand the companies and the people of Guam have for technology in our education, job force, and market.  

Free Code Camp Guam is a "campsite" of an international organization, [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).  
We start people off with FCC's free web development curriculum but expand to support many learning topics not covered in FCC.  
We chose FCC as the base of our community because of their values:

* **Education:** Free, Accessible, Quality Curriculums/Resources.  
* **Community:** Resources, Support, and Collaboration.  
* **Career-Minded:** Building skills, Connecting members with Employers.  
* **Charity:** Helping and Coding Pro-Bono for Non-Profits.
