          <p>
          In March of 2016, members from the Guam Chamber of Commerce and
          SHRM Guam Chapter <!-- Might be worth un-acronyming SHRM so people
          know what it is --> met to discuss the difficulties in finding
          IT skills here on island. They concluded that because of our unique
          <!-- geographic --> location and the fact that we are the connection
          point of many undersea cables, among other things, that Guam is the
          perfect place to build a market for technology. <!-- place to.. start/
          build a technology echosystem | build a technology market |
          something about economy?-->
          With this in mind, they created the Silicon Village project with
          the goal of recruiting developers from Guam by creating a technology
          infrastructure and nurturing the community to support it.
          <!-- ?? well then what is a "technology infrastructure"? -->

          <!-- moved from below section -->
          After the creation of Silicon Village, its first major focus was
          to create a program capable of gathering young minds with
          the incentive to learn technological skills, while cultivating an
          environment suitable to craft bonds between peers. Not long after,
          FreeCodeCamp Guam was born. <!--USING THEIR ULTRA SUPER POWERS, FREEY!

          <h3 class="featurette-heading">The Birth of FCCG</h3>
          <p>FCCG exploded on the scene with notable<!-- ? --> success.
          Over the period the official program took place, FCCG was able
          to gather people spanning multiple age groups, and inspire
          the curious to contribute their efforts to develop skills
          in the fields of computer science.

          <br />With a collection of accolades and feats to their name
          <!-- Consider specifying what accolades/feats-->, FCCG soon became the
          feet on the ground for efforts within the tech community.
          Free Code Camp Guam became notably visible, and has become
          independent in its activities, and has been a growing organization since.</p>

          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Now and in the Future</h3>
          <p>We want to provide free computer science education to every one.
          Therefore, we've been trying to start mini clubs in schools to get
          students excited about coding. Also, bootcamps are held to introduce
          and get people hooked onto computer programming. Afterward, if individuals
          are interested in learning more, we have meetups to entertain any
          questions and welcome new community members.
          <br />Currently, we are facilitating Girls Who Code, a weekly class
          teaching girls how to code. A club exists at John F. Kennedy
          high school, where students are able to learn about computer programming
          during lunch. Development for a bootcamp in February is in progress, and
          the theme will be game development. Ultimately, our goal is to build
          a community of not only people who know how to develop software, but
          also designers, artists, or musicians. We want to have a space where
          people with different backgrounds are able to convene and talk about
          code or commit to an activity together.</p>
